## Spotify: More styling

- In this exercise we will style our existing components. Style all the comonents you have created until know like `Albums`, `Songs`, `Libraries`, `Playlist` etc. Take the reference of [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/) for the designs
- Use [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling your components. styled-components lets you to create your css as a component so that you can reuse it multiple times. Like for `Albums` component you way have created `albums.css` to write all the styles related to the Albums module, instead use `styles.js` in the Albums folder and create a `AlbumsWrapper` using `styled-components`. You can refer to the [documentation](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#getting-started) for more reference
- One of the main reasons we also use `styled-components` is it generates unique class names for your styles. You never have to worry about duplication, overlap or misspellings
